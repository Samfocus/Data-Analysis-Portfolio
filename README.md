# Data Analysis Project
<h1>This project is a capstone case study for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</h1>


## Description
The following analysis is a capstone project requirement for the Google Data Analytics Certification. In this analysis, I will be focusing on Bellabeat, a wellness technology company focused on health-related products for women
<br />


## Introduction
Bellabeat, a cutting-edge manufacturer of health-focused products for women, envisions growing from a successful small company to a prominent player in the global smart device market. Bellabeat wants to analyze data that could help unlock new growth opportunities for the Company. As a junior data analyst working with the marketing team, i have been tasked with exploring and analyzing  a data from third-party health devices. The goal is to understand user habits and leverage this information to identify growth opportunities for their own products.
The project is divided into five phases: ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, and ACT phase.
<br />

## ASK PHASE
1.	BUSINESS TASK:
     Analyze usage data from 'Bellabeat' smart devices to gain actionable insights into consumer behavior and patterns. Utilize these insights to formulate targeted and effective marketing strategies for a 
     specific 'Bellabeat' product. Present the findings and recommendations to the executive team and the marketing analytic team, aiming to enhance the product's market positioning and drive its success in       the target market.
   
   
2.	KEY DELIVERABLES
   
     - A clear summary of the business task.
  	
     - Description of all data sources used.
  	
     - Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.
  	
     - A summary of analysis process.
  	
     - Supporting visualizations and key findings.

3.	STAKEHOLDERS:
   
    The stakeholders are:
   
     - Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer (primary stakeholder).
   
     - Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team (primary stakeholder).
   
     - Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy (secondary stakeholder).
   

## PREPARE PHASE
In this phase I will download and import the dataset. Then make sure the data is well understood, organized and credible

1.	Data source:
   
    Stakeholder encouraged me to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits. She points us to a specific dataset: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data: The data source   (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)


    -	This dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016.
  	
    -	The dataset is stored in 18 csv files.
  	
    -	This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from 30 fitbit users.
  	
    -	Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.


2.	Data frame description:
   
    The data frame includes the responses from 33 eligible Fitbit users to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016. Last modification date of the files is 2020-12-16. The files are in long and wide formats. The highest sample size of 33 distinct correspondents in dataset confers significant limitation and may not be an accurate representation of user’s population.

  - ***Summary of logged data:***

3.	Data Integrity & limitations:

   
     A good data source is expected to ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.

    - Reliable - Mid level: The dataset contains only 33 participants and the data is licensed by CC0: Public Domain and has a Kaggle score 10.00 (100% completeness, credibility, and compatibility).

    - Original - Mid level: the dataset is provided by third party on the Public Domain data frame made available through Kaggle user Mobius.

    - Comprehensive - high level: the dataset mentrics match Bellabeat's parameters, although there is no information about their gender, geographical location, professional background or other relevant data that can impact the further data analysis

    - Current - Mid level: the data was collected 7 years ago in 2016 However, the data might still be relevant for this task. More up-to-date data should be requested if needed. This should be discussed with the stakeholders if possible.

    - Cited - low level: data collected by third party and posted on Kaggle publicly.

  4.	Tools:

    	In this case study, R will be utilized for cleaning, analyzing, and formatting the data. To process the data, I considered using Excel, SQL, and R, all relying on filters, formulas, and essential functions. However, there are some files exceeding 1 million rows, like (minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv), Excel will be inadequate, making SQL and R more suitable for further data processing.

    	but I choose to use R because:

    	- R programming loads the data more easily and faster, expecially the large files.

    	- R programming can be used more easily during every step of this analysis as it has better documentation functions.

    	- I would like to try the ggplot2 function for R visualizations, so using R in all steps will make the analysis more consistent. SQL does not have in-built visualization functionality.

## PROCESS PHASE
In R studio environment, i uploaded the packages and related libraries that will be used for analysis.

   ```

- Reviewing the data:

After loading the data and reviewing it, I observed that ***dailyCalories_merged***, ***dailySteps_merged*** and ***dailyIntensities_merged*** were all included in ***dailyActivities_merged***. Therefore, I excluded the 3 data frames from the analysis. 

Furthermore, I excluded 6 more data frames:
 - minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged and minuteIntensitiesWide_merged have a column “Intensity” with values 0,1,2,3.... These values are not clear, and there is no additional explanation for what these values mean.
 - minuteCaloriesWide_merged and minuteStepsWide_merged was also exclude because their long format is preferred
 - minuteMETsNarrow_merged was excluded because we will be using the calorie data instead.
 - minuteSleep_merged have a column “Value” with values 1,2,3 which is not clear, and there is no additional explanation on what these values mean.
   
We further went to check if the selected 9 data frames actually include the data from 30 participants, as it was mentioned in the metadata. This is important that none of the data frames have less than 30 participants to ensure their credibility for the analysis. I used the ***(n_distinct) function***.

```n_distinct(dailyActivity_merged$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(sleepDay_merged$Id)
[1] 24
> n_distinct(minuteStepsNarrow_merged$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(hourlySteps_merged$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(weightLogInfo_merged$Id)
[1] 8
> n_distinct(minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(hourlyCalories_merged$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(hourlyIntensities_merged$Id)
[1] 33
> n_distinct(heartrate_seconds_merged$Id)
[1] 14
```

Based on these result we excluded two (2) data frames that were extremely low, ***weightLogInfo_merged*** and ***heartrate_seconds_merged***. Furthermore, Since the task is to identify the general trends, and we already have the same data available for days and hours, I will also exclude the 2 datasets with related minutes: ***minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged*** and ***minuteStepsNarrow_merged***.

I further observed and noticed that it is also possible to aggregate the hours data frames (hourlySteps_merged,hourlyIntensities_merged & hourlyCalories_merged) to simplify their use in the further data analysis because they all have 2 common columns(Id, ActivityHour)

```
activity_hrs_list<-list(hourlySteps_merged,hourlyIntensities_merged,hourlyCalories_merged)
activity_hourly_new<-activity_hrs_list %>%
reduce(inner_join,by=c("Id","ActivityHour"))

```
Now we have only 3 data frames (sleepDay_merged$Id, dailyActivity_merged$Id, activity_hourly_new) For the analysis.


- ## Data cleaning
  
To make sure each dataset is clean, I needed to check the following:

Columns in the data should be of the same type/format.
I have noticed that in the datasets, the column Date is inconsistent: different formats of date and time.

- I converted the date column as date type.

```
   dailyActivity_merged$ActivityDate<- as.Date(dailyActivity_merged$ActivityDate,format="%m/%d/%Y")
   activity_hourly_new$ActivityHour<-as.POSIXct(activity_hourly_new$ActivityHour,format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")
   sleepDay_merged$SleepDay <- as.Date(sleepDay_merged$SleepDay,format="%m/%d/%Y")
```

   - We further separated the date and time from activity_hourly_new.
     ```
     activity_hourly_new$ActivityDay<-as.Date(activity_hourly_new$ActivityHour)
     activity_hourly_new$ActivityTime<-format(as.POSIXct (activity_hourly_new$ActivityHour), format = "%H:%M:%S")
     ```
     
- All column names should be unique and consistent. Therefore I cleaned for inconsistent columns:
```
     sleepdays_clean <- clean_names(sleepDay_merged)
     activity_hours_clean <- clean_names(activity_hourly_new)
     daily_activities_clean <- clean_names(dailyActivity_merged)
```

- I checked if there are any empty fields or missing data
  ```
  sum(is.na(sleepdays_clean))
  [1] 0
  sum(is.na(activity_hours_clean))
  [1] 0
  sum(is.na(daily_activities_clean)
  [1] 0
  ```
 - I checked for duplicated rows

```
     sum(duplicated(sleepdays_clean))
     [1] 3
     sum(duplicated(activity_hours_clean))
     [1] 0
     sum(duplicated(daily_activities_clean))
     [1] 0
```

I observed that the data frame sleepdays_clean has three duplicated rows, Therefore I need to remove the duplicated rows
- Removing duplicated rows
```
sleep_days <- unique(sleepdays_clean)
```
I further rechecked if the duplicated data has been removed.
- Rechecking
  ```
  sum(duplicated(sleep_days))
  [1] 0
  ```
  
- Reviewing the final data frame (sleep_days, activity_hours_clean and daily_activities_clean)

```
     skim_without_charts(sleep_days)
     skim_without_charts(activity_hours_clean)
     skim_without_charts(daily_activities_clean)
```
- Data Preview
```
     head(sleep_days)
     head(activity_hours_clean)
     head(daily_activities_clean)
```

## ANALYZE AND SHARE PHASE
-Descriptive analysis

```
summary(daily_activities_clean)
summary(activity_hours_clean)
summary(daily_activities_clean)
 ```


- There is a need to understand the correlation of the Total_steps and Total_Calories burned for the entire month of observation grouped by participants (user id)
```
Total_calories_steps<- activity_hours_clean %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise(Total_calories=sum(calories), Total_steps=sum(step_total))

summary(Total_calories_steps)

cor(Total_calories_steps$Total_calories,Total_calories_steps$Total_steps)

  The correlation is 0.5611333
``` 

> Ploting Total Calories against Total steps to visualize the correlation and distribution

```
ggplot(data=Total_calories_steps) +

    axis.title = element_text(size = 14)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Correlation between Totalsteps and Totalcalories (Month)",
    x = "Total_Steps",
    y = "Total_Calories",
  )
```
![Rplot](https://github.com/Samfocus/Portfolio-1/assets/152339100/385776cc-10c1-492d-92c1-bb912e161b29)

>> There exists a correlation of approximately 56% between total steps and total calories burned. The summarized table indicates that some participants have an average daily calorie burned of around 2,170 and an average daily step count of 7,150. The correlation suggests a connection between the total steps taken and the calories burned, with variations observed among participants in terms of average daily steps and calorie consumption.

  
- I further checked for the Correlation between Hourly Total_steps and Calories to build a possible relationship

```
cor(activity_hours_clean$step_total,activity_hours_clean$calories)

 The correlation is 0.814968
```

    legend.title = element_text(size = 16), 
    legend.text = element_text(size = 16)
  ) +
  guides(color=guide_legend(title="Intensity")) +
  labs(
    title = "correlation between steps and calories (Hourly)",
    x = "Steps",
    y = "Calories",
  )
```
![Rplot2](https://github.com/Samfocus/Portfolio-1/assets/152339100/3cb40354-7413-46e7-8ac9-1ca703cfbef9)

>> There exists about 81% correlation between Hourly Calories burned and Hourly Total Steps, with a pronounced emphasis between 250 calories and 2500 steps, as evident in the chart. This substantial correlation implies a significant association between the total hourly calories burned and the total hourly steps taken, particularly within the high intensity range. Potential factors contributing to this correlation may include variations in physical activity levels and energy expenditure across different intervals of steps taken.



- There is need to explore which days of the week are users most and least active
  
```
activity_hours_clean$weekday <- wday(activity_hours_clean$activity_day, label=TRUE)
avg_intensity_mins <- activity_hours_clean %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarize(avg_intensity = mean(total_intensity))
```

> Ploting Weekdays against Average intensity per weekday to visualize its distribution
```
ggplot(data = avg_intensity_mins, aes(x = weekday, y = avg_intensity, fill=avg_intensity)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + geom_text(aes(label=round(avg_intensity,2)), vjust=-0.5)+
  theme(

![Rplot3](https://github.com/Samfocus/Portfolio-1/assets/152339100/6fb35e77-2acc-4f85-8f9d-8b000effa7e2)

>> This pattern suggests variations in users' activity levels on different days of the week. Possible causes for these fluctuations could include factors such as work schedules, fitness routines, or lifestyle preferences. The data infers that users tend to exhibit higher activity intensity on Saturdays and Tuesdays, with lower intensity on Sunday, indicating potential trends in their weekly activity patterns.



-The hours of the day users are most and least active should be considered

```
intensities_hrs_mean <- activity_hours_clean %>%
  group_by(activity_time) %>%
  summarize(avg_intensity_mins = mean(total_intensity))
```

>> The hourly distribution of average daily intensity indicates distinct patterns. It is notably low between 00:00:00 - 05:00:00, significantly high between 17:00:00 - 19:00:00, and relatively elevated between 12:00:00 - 14:00:00. There is varying intensity across the other hours. Possible causes for these patterns could include users engaging in lower-intensity activities during early morning hours, higher intensity during evening probably when returning home or during evening workout session, and moderately higher activity levels during lunch hours. The data infers that users tend to exhibit specific intensity preferences during different times of the day..

>> Analyzing the connection between lightly active minutes and the distance covered during light activity reveals a strong correlation of about 89%. This suggests a strong positive relationship between the duration of light activity and the corresponding distance covered. Possible causes for this high correlation could include users engaging in consistent light activities, such as walking, jogging, or other low-intensity exercises, resulting in a proportional increase in both light active minutes and distance covered. The data infers that users who accumulate more minutes in light activity also tend to cover longer distances during these activities

>> Examining the association between fairly active minutes and the distance covered during moderate activity reveals a remarkably high correlation of 0.946934. This indicates a strong positive relationship between the duration of fairly active minutes and the corresponding distance covered during moderate activities. The elevated correlation may stem from users consistently engaging in both fairly active minutes and moderate-distance activities between 50 minutes and 3km. This suggests that users who accumulate more minutes in fairly active activities also tend to cover longer distances during moderate-intensity exercises. The data infers a robust connection between these two variables in the users' activity records.

>> Exploring the connection between very active minutes and the distance covered during very active activities, a robust correlation of 0.8266815 is evident. This substantial correlation suggests a strong positive relationship between the duration of very active minutes and the corresponding distance covered during high-intensity activities. The notable correlation may arise from users consistently participating in both very active minutes and activities covering a distance of 6 km within a 60-minute timeframe. This observation implies a consistent and synchronized engagement in very active minutes and the associated distance among the users, reflecting a coherent pattern in their activity records.

>> Investigating the relationship between time spent in bed and the actual duration of sleep, a strong correlation of 0.9304224 is observed. This indicates a high positive association between the time individuals spend in bed and the corresponding time they are asleep. To express this correlation as a percentage, it equates to approximately 93.04%, suggesting that there is a consistent and significant connection between the two variables. In practical terms, this high correlation infers that as the time spent in bed increases, there is a corresponding increase in the time individuals spend asleep, emphasizing a substantial synchronization in their sleep patterns

 >> Most of the participants average sleep duration is around 7 hours on weekdays apart from Sundays which is slightly higher.
 
 
## Key findings
    
- It was noted that the daily step count of the majority of participants falls below the recommended threshold set by the CDC, which advises most adults to target 10,000 steps per day—roughly equivalent to 8 kilometers or 5 miles.

- On average, participants covered a distance of 5 km per day, with 60% of this distance attributed to slow walking. The average intensity of physical activity was evenly distributed throughout the week, with a preference for exercising during the lunch break or post-work hours.

- A significant positive correlation was identified between the distances covered and the intensity of physical activity.

- Generally, there was a direct relationship between the number of steps taken and the calories burned; however, there were instances where the Fitbit app indicated calorie expenditure during sedentary periods with zero steps

## Recommendations for the Bellabeat fitness tracker
  
- Ensure continuous tracking of all user activities within the application 24/7.
- Customize the app's minimum activity goals for each individual user to ensure they are attainable, fostering motivation through goal achievement.
- Promote increased user activity and evenly distribute activities throughout the day and week. Place particular emphasis on tracking Sunday activities and encouraging engagement before 10:00 and after 20:00, leading up to bedtime.
- Implement a feature in the tracker to discern whether it is on the user's body or not. This is crucial to prevent inaccurate user information. The application should prohibit calorie estimation in the absence of tracked activity.
